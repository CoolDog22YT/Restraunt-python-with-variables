# Restraunt-python-with-variables
It is a restaurant typing game that uses python 
This is my first real code creation and i hope anyone who see's this likes it i worked very hard.
It may be very basic but i will update it as i go. Most of the coding was leaned from youtube. This was made using replit and im not sure how to run it without using replit.
